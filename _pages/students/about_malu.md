## Maria Luísa Lima <span class="student-badge msc">MSc</span>

Maria Luísa Lima is a master’s student researching fairness and bias in computer vision for autonomous driving. Her masters introduces the first benchmark dataset focused on pedestrian centered Latin American traffic scenarios and analyzes how state-of-the-art detection models perform under regional and demographic diversity. Her interests lie at the intersection of AI fairness, human-centered evaluation, and safety-critical systems, with a focus on ensuring that next-generation ADAS technologies work reliably across diverse global populations.
