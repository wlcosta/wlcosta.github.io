Brenna D’Castro is a master’s student at the Voxar Labs, working on human-computer interaction applied to the teleoperation of heavy vehicles. Her research explores how factors such as cognitive load, situational awareness, and multisensory feedback impact the experience and performance of remote operators, with a special focus on the Latin American context. Coming from a design undergraduate background, she is particularly interested in creating interfaces that integrate artificial intelligence, usability, and immersive feedback to enhance safety, trust, and efficiency in human-machine collaboration.
