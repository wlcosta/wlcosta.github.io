Hey there! I'm Will, an R&D project leader on Voxar Labs working with human behavior recognition. Iâ€™m particularly interested in applying these techniques to real-world scenarios. I received my PhD from the Federal University of Pernambuco, :flag_brazil:. I'm also an active member in the [LXAI](https://www.latinxinai.org/) community, empowering LatinX researchers working with Artificial Intelligence and mainly Computer Vision.
