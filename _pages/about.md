Hi, I'm Willams (or Will), an R&D Scientific Project Manager specializing in human behavior recognition at [Voxar Labs](https://voxarlabs.cin.ufpe.br), part of the [Centro de InformÃ¡tica](https://cin.ufpe.br) in Recife, Brazil. My work centers on using behavioral analytics, particularly human behavior recognition, to address real-world challenges across industries like automotive, healthcare, and business. Currently, my research focuses on fairness and responsible AI in the context of self-driving vehicles.

I hold a PhD from the Federal University of Pernambuco ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and am an active member of the [LatinX in AI](https://www.latinxinai.org) community, which aims to bridge academia, industry, and underrepresented communities to advance AI innovation. I'm also involved in other AI communities, including Google Research@SÃ£o Paulo, and regularly contribute as a reviewer for prestigious conferences such as ISMAR, SIBGRAPI, and IEEE Intercon, as well as for renowned journals.
