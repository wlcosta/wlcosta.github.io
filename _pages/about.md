Hi there, my name is Willams (or Will, for short), an R&D Scientific Project Manager working with human behavior recognition on [Voxar Labs](https://voxarlabs.cin.ufpe.br), a research lab located within [Centro de InformÃ¡tica](https://cin.ufpe.br) in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. I'm particularly interested in applying human behavior recognition techniques and approaches to solve real-world problems for automotive applications and healthcare. I received my PhD from the Federal University of Pernambuco, ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. I'm also an active member in the [LatinX in AI](https://www.latinxinai.org) community, which has the mission of bridging communities, academics and industries to further AI innovation and development, empowering LatinX researchers globally.
