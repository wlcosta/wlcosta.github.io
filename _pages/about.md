Hi there! My name is Willams (or Will, for short). I am an AI R&D Technical Program Manager at [Voxar Labs](https://voxarlabs.cin.ufpe.br), a leading research lab based at the [Centro de InformÃ¡tica](https://cin.ufpe.br) in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. My role bridges the gap between research and real-world applications, driving innovative projects in AI and computer vision with a strong emphasis on societal impact. I specialize in human behavior recognition, responsible AI and multimodal AI systems, collaborating with global partners to tackle complex, real-world challenges.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the Federal University of Pernambuco ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, where my research focused on deep learning techniques for human behavior recognition. Beyond my work at Voxar Labs, Iâ€™m an active member of the LatinX in AI community, dedicated to empowering LatinX researchers globally by fostering connections between communities, academics, and industries to advance AI innovation.

Iâ€™m also deeply involved in other AI initiatives, including Google Research@SÃ£o Paulo, and I contribute as a reviewer for prestigious conferences and journals such as ISMAR, SIBGRAPI, IEEE Intercon, and more. Passionate about bridging academia and industry, I thrive at the intersection of technical excellence, strategic leadership, and societal impact.

Letâ€™s connect and collaborate to drive impactful AI research and innovation!
